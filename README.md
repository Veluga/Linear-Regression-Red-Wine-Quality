A Linear Regression Model that uses 'physiochemical properties' as features to calculate a quality score (usually determined by a professional human tester) of a red wine strain. 

The predictions made by the model on the test set closely match the findings of the researchers. 

To initiate, navigate to the directory and run the 'model.py' file using the command 'python model.py'. 1000 steps of Gradient Descent will be performed, the accuracy and MAD values will be output afterwards.

This was useful for me to improve my ability of applying concepts such as vectorization, feature scaling, working with a CSV dataset and of course Gradient Descent itself.
